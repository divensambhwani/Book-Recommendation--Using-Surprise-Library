# Book-Recommendation--Using-Surprise-Library

Weâ€™ll be working with the Book-Crossing data set. It comprises three tables,
we will use two of them: The users table and the Book ratings table and using 
these two tables we will recommend the books to the users focussing on Collaborative Filtering approach. 

Collaborative Filtering in short means the user is recommended items that people with similar tastes and 
preferences liked in the past.
